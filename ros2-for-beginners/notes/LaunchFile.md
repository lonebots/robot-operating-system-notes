# Launch File in ROS

In real world scenarios we may need to start muliple nodes with varrying node_names, parameters etc according to the required architecture in a scalable pattern. Thus we use a single script file that contains information about all the nodes and their specific configurations to start. 

`One such file that contains all the configurations of the nodes and their parameters, that helps in starting them with a single launch command is known as a Launch file`
