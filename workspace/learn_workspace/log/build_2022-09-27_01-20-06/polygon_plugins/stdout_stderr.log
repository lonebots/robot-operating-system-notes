[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpolygon_base.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "polygon_base", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "polygon_base" with
  any of the following names:

    polygon_baseConfig.cmake
    polygon_base-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "polygon_base" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "polygon_base_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "polygon_base" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
